It's a C#.Net desktop application. There are three types of users, including administrators, doctors, and patients. Patients are allowed to book an appointment, predict their disease with a simple algorithm, view their medical history, and choose blood donors. Doctors will be able to see and print the list of appointments and provide prescriptions to the patient. The administrator will be able to see the user's number and will be able to update the donors' and doctors' lists.
